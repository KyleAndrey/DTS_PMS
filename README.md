## Setup

The method of setting up a local version of the system can be broken down into two different parts:

### Initial Setup

1) Download the .zip file on the main page of the GitHub and extract the .zip file to your desired location.
2) Once extracted, open [Visual Studio Code Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics) (or [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-5.1)).
3) On the prompt, change to the DTS_ManagementSystem directory:
  e.g. - `cd C:\Users\Username\Downloads\DTS_ManagementSystem`
4) Next, to create a virtual environment and install dependencies (you can also create a requirements file from here), enter in the following:
  e.g. - `python env.py`
